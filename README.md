# covid_19_ML_Algo
Descriptive Research on Covid-19 Dataset


## Introduction

This repository hosts a machine learning project aimed at analyzing and predicting trends related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Leveraging machine learning algorithms, we seek to gain insights into the spread of the virus, predict future trends, and assist in decision-making processes related to public health interventions.



## Dataset: 
The project utilizes publicly available datasets related to COVID-19, including data on confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, testing rates, vaccination rates, and other relevant metrics. The datasets are sourced from reputable sources such as the World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and other official health organizations.


## Tools and Technologies
The project is developed using Python programming language and various libraries and frameworks commonly used in machine learning and data analysis, including but not limited to:


NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
TensorFlow
Matplotlib
Seaborn
